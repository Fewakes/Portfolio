        <span className="italic">My favorite part of programming</span> is the
        problem-solving aspect, as well as the never-ending 'chase' to learn new
        things. I <span className="underline">love</span> the feeling of finally
        figuring out a solution to a problem. My core stack is{" "}
        <span className="font-medium">React.js</span>. I am also familiar with
        TypeScript. I am always looking to learn new technologies. I am
        currently looking for a{" "}
        <span className="font-medium">full-time position</span> as a software
        developer.
